This is a **test** file. **test** is in bold.

I can do *italics*.

If I put text in backticks for inline code formatting.
For example, here is the `ls` command.

Or, I can do a code block:

```
for 1 in *; do
  echo "$i"
done
```

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
4. item 4
5. item 5
6. item 6

- item a
- item b
- item c
- item d
- item e
- item f

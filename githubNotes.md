# GitHub Notes

> "This is fun." -Me, 20 minutes ago

What have I learned? I've never done anything like this before so everything is new.

But **what** specifically? Here are some things:

1. how to use github
2. how to set up a repository
3. basic markdown formatting options

One random thing I liked learning was the name for camel case.
I've seen it before (notably in a scifi book I like) but didn't know it had a name.

Here it is:

It's so *good*.

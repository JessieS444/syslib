# Installing Apache, PHP, and MySQL

## Apache:
- I installed Apache as per this week's instructions.
- Both the `w3m 127.0.0.1` and `w3m localhost` commands worked for me to access the webpage I created.
- I don't know HTML so I coped and pasted the provided code in order to get started with building the content of my webpage.
- Code provided:
- ```
  <html>
<head>
<title>My first web page using Apache2</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to my web site.
I created this site using the Apache2 HTTP server.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
- Overall, I found this process to be more simple than I thought it would be.
- I played with the HTML code we were given to make my website look like this:
- hi

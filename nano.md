# Nano
## Nano is a command line text editor.

To open nano, simply type "nano" into command line. This opens a blank page.
To open nano with a specific file name, type "nano filename". If the filename already exists then this command will open it.

Nano has old origins before Common User Access guidelines standardized keyboard shortcuts.
>(That means that it uses different shortcuts than the normal 'ctrl-v' and 'ctrl-c' shortcuts.)

Here are the shortcuts:
- 'Ctrl-s' to save current file
- 'Ctrl-o' to write file (write out means save)
- 'Ctrl-r' to insert a file into current one
- 'Ctrl-x' to save and quit
- 'M-6' to copy current line
- 'Ctrl-u' to paste
- 'M-u' to undo
- 'M-e' to redo
- 'M-W' to search
- 'M-Del' to delete current line
- 'Ctrl-g' to display help info

"Buffer" is like temporary file.
